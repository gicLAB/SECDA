# SECDA: Efficient Hardware/Software Co-Design of FPGA-based DNN Accelerators for Edge Inference
SECDA is a hardware-software co-design methodology for efficiently designing and implementing FPGA-based DNN accelerators. The methodology employs SystemC simulation in parallel with accelerator driver co-design and early system integration, reducing the length of each design iteration cycle, therefore, reducing the time to deliver the final design.

# Paper
Our research paper covers the methodology in detail including our initial case study using SECDA. If you have using the SECDA methodology in research, we kindly request a reference to the following:

# SECDA-TFLite
This repo contains the work for our initial case study using this methodology where we developed and implemented two GEMM accelerator designs for CONV2D layers within for TFLite inference. Here we publish the source code to reproduce our methodology case study, along with the accelerator designs we have developed.
