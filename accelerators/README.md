# Accelerators
* This folder contains the SystemC source code for the Vector MAC and Systolic Array accelerators
* You are able to syntheisis these accelerators using Vivado 2019.2
* Use the archived Vivado HLS & Vivado projects for the respective accelerator ([release](https://github.com/gicLAB/SECDA/releases/tag/v1.0)) to make the synthesis steps easier
* The Vivado HLS archived projects also provided the testbench/dma SystemC modules required to perform standalone SystemC simulation along with the input data required to drive simulation
